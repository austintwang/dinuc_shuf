# dinuc_shuf

This is a simple Python package with a single function `shuffle` that does a dinucleotide shuffle on input sequences.

A dinucleotide shuffle preserves the dinucleotide (doublet) frequencies of the input sequence while randomizing the order of the dinucleotides. This is useful for generating compositionally-matched random sequences.
